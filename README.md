a set of tools of Sina Microblog & Baidu Post Bar by Python 3.


I will try my best to write the English document, juse because my English is very pool. Also, it's a good time to learn English and  Python. How wonderful! Let's go ~


## microblog_rcl

"rcl" means Repost, Comment, Like. this tool is used for automatic repost, comment, like or called thumb up?

In addition, comment and repost will post with Super Topic (what a direct translation), which is composed of Chinese characters, like "#张三#". 

if wrong, you can modify it in user.ini simply. I also learned something of [Selenium](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/py/index.html) due to this opportunity.
