Weibo-Selenium
====
A set of tools of Sina Weibo by Python 3.


I will try my best to write the English document, it's a good time to learn English and Python. How wonderful! Let's go ~


## sina_weibo_rcl

Firstly, "rcl" means Repost, Comment, Like. This tool is used for automatic repost, comment, like or called thumb up?

In addition, comment and repost will post with Super Topic (what a direct translation), which is composed of Chinese characters, like "#张三#". 

If wrong, you can modify it in user.ini simply. I also learned something of [Selenium](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/py/index.html) due to this opportunity.
